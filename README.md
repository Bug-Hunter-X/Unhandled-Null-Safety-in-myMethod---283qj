# Unhandled Null Safety in Dart

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart related to null safety.  The `myMethod()` function doesn't explicitly handle the case where `_myVariable` might be null, leading to potential unexpected behavior.  While the code runs without crashing due to the null-aware operator (`??`), a more robust solution explicitly addresses null checks for better code clarity and maintainability.
